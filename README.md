# Targeted Ads
I have used multiple classification model of ML to predict whom to send ads based on their age and estimated salary.

## How to run files in this repository

* Open .ipynb file using "Google colab". 
* In google colab upload the Social_Network_Ads.csv
* Run all cells
* To predict for a particular person enter their age and salary in 2D array, keeping feature scaling in mind, to predict function.

## Accuracy of different models.

## What I have achieved

* I have successfully trained data on different classification model.
* Have reached optimum accuracy.
* Confusion Matrix has been used for determining accuracy.
